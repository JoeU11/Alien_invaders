# Development Plan

## Basic Development

### Next steps
1. Have targets move towards bottom of screen over time (and maybe wiggle side-to-side later)
2. Generate more than one row of targets
3. Clean up. Parse classes into separate files. 

### To Add
- enemy targets (generate into array)
  - add targets moving closer and game over condition when collide with player or bottom of screen
  - increase speed of target generation
- score tracking and display

### Long Term
- different levels
- additional lives?
- random drops from enemies. grant buffs (or currency) when collected

### Misc features

- boundaries on left and right for player
- final score page on game over
